  In order to create a new user, you need to enter a name and nine weights, from the oldest to the newest.
%p
  If you donâ€™t have nine weights, you can enter fewer, but you wonâ€™t get a signal until you have nine.
%ul
  -@user.errors.full_messages.each do |msg|
    %li.errors= msg
%p
  =form_for @user do |f|
    =f.label :name
    =f.text_field :name
    %br
    =f.label :weights
    (oldest)
    =f.text_field :weights, :size => 50
    (today)
    %br
    = f.submit "Create"
